### Setup
Because this app is an open-source hobby project and not signed with a paid certificate, your OS may flag it on the first run.

> 🛡️ **Windows Users:**
> You may see a blue popup saying **"Windows protected your PC"** (Microsoft Defender SmartScreen).
>
> To start the app, click **More info**, then click **Run anyway**.

> 🍎 **MacOS Users:**
> You may see an error saying **"App is damaged and can't be opened"** or **"Unidentified Developer"** (Gatekeeper).
>
> To fix this, type the following command in Terminal: `xattr -cr`, then drag the app file into the terminal window to auto-fill the path.

BCC requires two additonal third-party resources to unlock full functionality. Without these, the apps capabilities are limited:
- Rooted Android device/emulator that is not Bluestacks and can run The Battle Cats
- Legally obtained Decryption Keys and Initialization Vectors for every region

## Credit
Various people have motivated and helped me create this project:
- **TheWWRNerdGuy:** Provided a repo which holds Rust code for reading raw game data, also gave coding tips.
- **SweetDonut0:** Used their Cat Stats Tool & Animation Viewer web-app hosted on the Wiki as a reference for code.
- **fieryhenry:** Coder with many Battle Cats related projects of their own, of which I took inspiration from.
- **Timtams:** Did field research to confirm certain game data quirks, also supplied some custom assets.
